# Service Level Agreement (SLA)

**Effective Date:** 09/16/2025  
**Applies to:** ZettaQuant Native App ("the Application")

---

## 1. Purpose
This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") defines the levels of service, support, and responsibilities for consumers of the Application. It outlines severity levels, response times, and support channels across both free and paid tiers.

---

## 2. Scope
- This SLA applies to all users of the Application deployed via Snowflake Native Apps.  
- It covers **availability, incident response, and support services**.  
- It does not cover:  
  - Issues caused by customer misconfiguration, third-party integrations, or force majeure.  
  - Features outside the scope of the Application package.  
  - Snowflake platform issues (covered by [Snowflake’s Support Policy](https://www.snowflake.com/en/legal/terms-of-service/)).

---

## 3. Service Availability
- The Application is designed to be available **24×7**, excluding scheduled maintenance.  
- Scheduled maintenance notifications will be posted via Community forums and Email.

| **Sev 2 (High)** | Major functionality impaired, no acceptable workaround | Classified as Sev 4 | Response within 4 business hours, resolution within 1 business day |

## 7. Responsibilities

---

## 8. Reporting & Reviews

- Paid customers may request SLA performance reports quarterly.

---

## 9. Exclusions
The SLA does not apply in the following cases:  
- Issues caused by Snowflake outages or network failures outside ZettaQuant’s control.  
- Force majeure (e.g., natural disasters, internet backbone issues).
